1. create an async function called writer that takes 0 arguments, and that writes three lines
 to a file named temp.txt, by calling the writeFile function with await. 
 The Promise version of writeFile takes the same arguments as the one you used in last weekâ€™s 
 exercise 10-fs-sync but will return a Promise instead of a result directly.
