/*This program should use the console.log function to write some globals 
to the screen. Set an environment variable with the following command in your command 
line terminal: export MY_VAR="Hi there!" The program should then use console.
log to print out the values of __dirname (a Node global variable) and
process.env.MY_VAR (process is also a global, and contains the environment variables
you set in your terminal.) You could print out other globals as well
(Node documentation on available globals). For each of these programs, 
you invoke them with node to make sure they work.*/



console.log("__dirname: ",__dirname);
console.log(process.env.MY_VAR);
setInterval(()=>{
    console.log("Hello World")}, 1000);
